### Hey, How are you? 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 😄
I'm Guilherme Vitchenzo, student's Programming (for now Junior).

I started in the Programming World in 2020 and since then I haven't stopped study, I'm always looking for more.

- ✔️ Some Languages I know: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, NodeJS(API's), C#(styding now);
- 💭 I want learning: ReactJS/React Native, TypeScript.
